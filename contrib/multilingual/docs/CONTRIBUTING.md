## How It Works (Two-Minute Version)

The module wraps SkillSpector's single-skill pipeline inside a parallel map:

```python
# What upstream does:
state → graph.invoke(state) → result    # one skill at a time

# What we do:
ThreadPoolExecutor.map(graph.invoke, [state_1, state_2, ...])   # N skills in parallel
```

The complication: DeepSeek's API doesn't support `response_format` (structured
output).  Upstream's `LLMAnalyzerBase` calls `with_structured_output()`
unconditionally.  Sending `response_format` to DeepSeek returns HTTP 400,
corrupting the connection pool.

Our 7 import-time patches (`runner.py`) work around this by:
1. Disabling structured output (instance-level `response_schema = None`)
2. Adding JSON format instructions to every prompt
3. Parsing raw JSON strings manually
4. Enforcing HTTP timeouts to prevent hung connections
5. Silencing harmless asyncio cleanup noise

All patches execute at module import — before any thread starts.  Each uses
instance attributes (not class attributes) for thread safety.

## Mapping to Upstream SkillSpector

| Upstream concept | Our equivalent | File |
|-----------------|----------------|------|
| `graph.invoke(state)` | `run_one(skill_dir, root, use_llm, lang)` | `runner.py` |
| `LLMAnalyzerBase` | `GapFillAnalyzer(LLMAnalyzerBase)` subclass | `gap_fill.py` |
| `get_chat_model(model)` | `create_api_key_pool_from_env()` → `PooledChatModel` | `api_pool.py` |
| `build_context` node | `_read_skill_files()` | `batch_scan.py` |
| `report.py:_format_json()` | `_format_json(results)` (batch envelope added) | `reports.py` |
| `cli.py scan` command | `batch_scan.py main()` | `batch_scan.py` |
| `ARG1 + env vars` | `argparse` CLI + `.env` dotenv | `batch_scan.py` + `__init__.py` |
| `ANALYZER_NODE_IDS` registry | `_ENGLISH_KEYWORD_RULES` frozenset | `annotation.py` |
| `state["findings"]` with `operator.add` | `annotate_findings()` wrapper | `annotation.py` |

## Key Design Decisions (And Why)

### Zero intrusion on `src/skillspector/`

We subclass, wrap, and monkey-patch — never modify upstream source.  Reason:
upstream releases can be pulled without merge conflicts.  If upstream adds a
native `response_schema=None` mode (e.g., via env var), our patches become
no-ops and can be removed.

### Instance attributes for thread safety

The original approach mutated `LLMAnalyzerBase.response_schema` (class
attribute, shared across all threads).  Race: Thread A restores the original
value while Thread B's meta-analyzer is still creating instances → 400 error.

Fix: `self.response_schema = None` writes to `self.__dict__`.  Python MRO finds
the instance attribute before the class attribute.  Each analyzer gets its own
`None` — zero shared state, zero races.

### httpx.Timeout injection before client caching

`ChatOpenAI.__init__` caches the OpenAI client eagerly.  Patching `timeout`
after construction is too late — the cached client keeps the old value.
Our patch intercepts `__init__` kwargs and overwrites `timeout` (the Pydantic
alias, which v2 prefers over the canonical `request_timeout`) before the
original constructor runs.

## Where to Contribute

### High-impact, moderate-effort

1. **Route graph-internal LLM calls through ApiKeyPool.**  Currently only
   gap-fill uses the pool.  SSD/SDI/SQP/meta share a single key.  Fix: patch
   `LLMAnalyzerBase.__init__` to use `PooledChatModel` when
   `SKILLSPECTOR_API_KEYS` is configured.  Requires solving pool visibility
   (the pool instance must be reachable from the patched `__init__`).

2. **Add checkpoint/resume.**  Write per-skill results to
   `_batch_checkpoint.jsonl` as each skill completes.  On restart, skip skills
   already in the checkpoint.  A 50-line change to `batch_scan.py`.

3. **Add language-detection unit tests.**  Create `tests/test_detection.py`
   with known zh/ja/ko/en file content and verify `detect_language()` output.
   Low complexity, high confidence payoff.

### Moderate-impact, moderate-effort

4. **Expand language detection.**  Add Cyrillic (U+0400–U+04FF → `ru`/`uk`),
   Arabic (U+0600–U+06FF → `ar`), Devanagari (U+0900–U+097F → `hi`).  Each
   is a 3-line change to `detection.py` with threshold constants.

5. **Add SARIF output format.**  Model after upstream's SARIF formatter.
   `Finding` objects map cleanly to SARIF's `result.locations[].physicalLocation`.

6. **Build non-English ground-truth fixtures.**  Create zh/ja/ko skills with
   known vulnerabilities across the 8 gap-fill rules.  Run gap-fill and measure
   precision/recall.  Publish as `tests/fixtures/multilingual/`.

### Lower-priority

7. **Add `--diff` mode.**  Compare two batch JSON reports and show skills that
   changed score.
8. **Deduplicate `_strip_markdown_fences`.**  Currently lives in both
   `runner.py` and `gap_fill.py`.  Move to a shared utility.
9. **Reduce `report.py` Rich StringIO fragility.**  Use `Console(record=True)`
   without `file=` parameter.

## Code Conventions

This module follows SkillSpector upstream conventions exactly:

- **SPDX header** on every `.py` file
- `from __future__ import annotations` as first import
- Imports: stdlib → third-party → internal (`skillspector.*`) → relative (`.`)
- `| None` syntax for optional types (not `Optional[X]`)
- `frozenset` / `Final` for module-level constants (`UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`)
- Private helpers: `_lower_snake_case` functions
- `logger = get_logger(__name__)` in every module with log calls
- Comments explain **why**, not what (the code shows what)
- Docstrings on all public functions and classes

## Testing

### Manual verification (current)

```bash
# Static mode (sub-second)
python -m contrib.multilingual.batch_scan ./tests/fixtures/ -f terminal --workers 8 --no-llm

# LLM mode (~2 min)
python -m contrib.multilingual.batch_scan ./tests/fixtures/ -f terminal --workers 8
```

Verify: 23/23 skills scanned, exit code 1 (HIGH/CRITICAL skills present),
`safe_skill` and `ssd_clean` both 0/100.

### Writing new tests

Test files should mirror the source structure:
```
tests/
├── test_detection.py    # for contrib/multilingual/detection.py
├── test_api_pool.py     # for contrib/multilingual/api_pool.py
└── ...
```

Use the upstream project's test infrastructure: `pytest --verbose`.
LLM-dependent tests should mock `get_chat_model()` and `chat_completion()`.

## Commit Style

Follow upstream conventions:
- Present-tense, imperative mood: `fix:`, `feat:`, `docs:`
- Reference upstream issue/PR numbers when relevant
- Co-authored-by trailer for joint work
